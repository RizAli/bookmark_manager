installation notes

1. brew install postgresql

After homebrew has downloaded the software it will show you some installation instructions, follow them! Ok, they might not be that readable ;)


ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents


launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist


to check installation type in psql
postgres#  \q

to talk to the database, we will need the datamapper gem. it is an ORM(object-relational mapper)
this is a convenient way to interact with our data using classes and objects instead of working with database tables directly.

web project has atleast three environments
==========================================
development, test and production

--  the environment the shell variables are in and
--  the environment the project is running in are two different concepts
that share the same name

the environment the project is running in determines the behaviour of the project.

example: if we have e-commerce project
our payment processing would be different for the three environment:
Production
-------------------------------------------
--  in production(when real customers use it)
Development
----------------------------------------------
--  all credit cards would be charged for real in development(when writing code)
Test
---------------------------------------------
--  we would use special "development" credit cards that behave like real ones, except
that no money is actually spent in test(when running automated tests)
